# üêøÔ∏è LLM-Based Web Browsing Agent

Create a web browsing agent with natural language.

Language is the most natural interface by which humans give and receive instructions. Creating and adding agents should be as simple as defining sequences of instructions in plain text, and then chaining together those subroutines. 

## ‚õ©Ô∏è Motivation and Architecture

This repo was inspired by the work of [Yihui He](https://github.com/yihui-he/ActGPT), [Adept.ai](https://adept.ai/), and [Nat Friedman](https://github.com/nat/natbot). In particular, the basic abstractions were built off of Yihui's hackathon code. Adept and Nat Friedman, of course, broke ground with their demos.

TODO describe the prompts, the abstractions, and the relationship between text prompts and the agent capabilities.


## üèóÔ∏è Installation

1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Download Chromedriver (latest stable release) from [here](https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/) and place it in the same folder as this file. Unzip.
3. In Finder, right click the unpacked chromedriver and click "Open". This will remove the restrictive default permissions and allow Python to access it.


## ü¶≠ Usage
### üó∫Ô∏è API
The form factor is fairly simple (see below). The harder (but funner) part is writing the natural language prompts.

```python
from agents.gpt_selenium_agent import GPTSeleniumAgent

instructions = """Go to Google.com
Find all text boxes.
Find the first visible text box.
Click on the first visible text box.
Type in "buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo" and press enter.
Wait 2 seconds.
Find all anchor elements that link to Wikipedia.
Click on the first one.
Wait for 10 seconds."""

agent = GPTSeleniumAgent(instructions, "/path/to/chromedriver")
agent.run()
```

### üìë Writing Prompts

It helps if you are familiar with how Selenium works and programming in general, because effectively I am using GPT-3 to translate natural language into code, so you should be as precise as you can. In this way, it is more like writing code with Copilot than it is talking to a friend; for instance, it helps to refer to things as text boxes (vs. "search box") or buttons which say "Log in" rather than "the login button". Sometimes, it will also not pick up on specific words that are important, so it helps to break them out into separate lines. Instead of "find all the visible text boxes", you do "find all the text boxes" and then "find the first visible text box".

You can look at some examples in `prompts/examples` to get started.

Create "functions" by enclosing instructions in ```BEGIN_FUNCTION func_name``` and ```END_FUNCTION```, and then call them by starting a line with ```RUN_FUNCTION```. Below is an example:

```
BEGIN_FUNCTION search_buffalo
Go to Google.com
Find all text boxes.
Find the first visible text box.
Click on the first visible text box.
Type in "buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo" and press enter.
Wait 2 seconds.
Get all anchors on the page that contain the word "buffalo".
Click on the first link.
END_FUNCTION

RUN_FUNCTION search_buffalo
Wait for 10 seconds.
```

## ‚úãüèº Contributing
There are two ways I envision folks contributing.

- **Adding to the Prompt Library**: Read "Writing Prompts" above and simply make a pull request to add something to `prompts/`! This would be a particularly attractive option for those who aren't as familiar with coding.
- **Contributing code**: Happy to take suggestions! The main way to add to the repository is to extend the capabilities of the agent. TODO

## üöß TODOs and Future Work
In order of easiest to hardest.
- [ ] Finish the README.
- [ ] Make gif.
- [x] GPTSeleniumAgent should be able to load prompts and cached successful runs in the form of yaml files. InstructionCompiler should be able to save instructions to yaml.
- [ ] Demo/test something where it has to ask the LLM to synthesize something it reads online.
- [ ] üí≠ Give the agent a memory which it can use to store information for read/write purposes.
- [ ] üéØ Get the specific point in the stack trace that something failed, and start executing from there.
- [ ] ü•û Better stack trace virtualization to make it easier to debug.
- [ ] üö® If anyone can figure out how to feed the content of the HTML page into the GPT-3 context window and have it reliably pick out specific elements from it, that would be great!
